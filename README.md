# tsh (Turtle SHell)

Turtle SHell is an interactive shell similar to bash or zsh, but far worse.

There is no reason at all that you should use this software. The eventual
goal for this software is to be used in cyber defense competitions as a
horrible replacement for bash that does unexpected and unusual things.
